There were years of chaos, killing and the rise and fall of tribes and kingdoms that is where the great Romans once ruled. Still the legacy of Rome never dies. But in the start of the middle ages beyond the known world to the harsh lands in the north, people of great size and strength seek new lands to conquer and settle.\r\n\r\nThese people are known as the Vikings. In the west in the middle of Europe, power hungry rulers are waging war at each other while struggling with the northern invaders that keep raiding their lands and taking their wealth and there people to sell as slaves. Some of the men never leaves, seeing potential for this land to be their own. \r\n\r\nIn the south, into the lands of North Africa and the Middle East, the Arabs are strong in faith and in honour. Their land is big but are always looking for more. To the east, the Baltic and Russian lands are engaged in trade with foreign countries but always looking to push back the north men from their lands and conquer new.\r\n\r\nIt is your choice to become what you want, a solider, a merchant, a farmer and family man, a bandit, a lord or even a king. Just use your imagination my friend.\r\n\r\nYou can even build your own claims. Your freedom to make cities and weapons. Choose your life carefully my dear friend. Though it’s your desire.\r\n\r\nMaybe one day you will be the Knight in the shining armour. Welcome to the glory ages.\r\nWe will start an age of glory choose your friends and foes wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License \r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Glory Age</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"https://github.com/LunizStudios/Glory-Ages\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Luniz Studios</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" href=\"https://github.com/LunizStudios/Glory-Age\" rel=\"dct:source\">https://github.com/LunizStudios/Glory-Ages</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\" rel=\"cc:morePermissions\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Users and team\r\nMade by a hand of people, \r\nAdmins: @ItsaPerryBob & @jekkenmann.\r\nOther dev's: @Emiliapusen & @xpurpleturtlex\r\nVoice actors: @sebeluniz, searching also others!\r\n\r\n### Our site?\r\nhttp://www.catchmeifyoucan.ga\r\nor our email: fuck@catchmeifyoucan.comlu.com\r\n\r\n### Donate?\r\n\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\" target=\"_top\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"KRYLCA35Y5FEJ\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/GB/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal – The safer, easier way to pay online.\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/no_NO/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>\r\n",
