This game is an mmorpg with sandbox. (Based of Medieval Times.) Made by a team of Luniz Studios! 

#Intro:

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the greatest empire ever known to Man. There were years of chaos, killing and the rise and fall of tribes and kingdoms that is where the great Romans once ruled. Still the legacy of Rome never dies. But in the start of the middle ages beyond the known world to the harsh lands in the north, people of great size and strength seek new lands to conquer and settle.

These people are known as the Vikings. In the west in the middle of Europe, power hungry rulers are waging war at each other while struggling with the northern invaders that keep raiding their lands and taking their wealth and there people to sell as slaves. Some of the men never leaves, seeing potential for this land to be their own. 

In the south, into the lands of North Africa and the Middle East, the Arabs are strong in faith and in honour. Their land is big but are always looking for more. To the east, the Baltic and Russian lands are engaged in trade with foreign countries but always looking to push back the north men from their lands and conquer new.

It is your choice to become what you want, a solider, a merchant, a farmer and family man, a bandit, a lord or even a king. Just use your imagination my friend.

You can even build your own claims. Your freedom to make cities and weapons. Choose your life carefully my dear friend. Though itâ€™s your desire.

Maybe one day you will be the Knight in the shining armour. Welcome to the glory ages.
We will start an age of glory choose your friends and foes wisely.
